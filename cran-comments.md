This is the new version of the package which includes these new functionalities: 

- A new argument within each function :askRobot: which allows the user to check if he has the right to scrap a web page 

- I've modified the clean argument to make it faster 

- I've introduced two new functions : 

* table_scrap(): allows the user to extract an HTML table from a webpage
* weblink_scrap(): allows the user to extract all web links within a web page. This can be useful in specific cases.
