# ralger

The goal of **ralger** is to facilitate web scraping in R. 

## Installation


You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("feddelegrand7/ralger")
```
## Example

This is an example which shows how to extract firms' denomination from the website of the Algerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CACI). For simplicity, we'll focus on firms operating in the capital. 

```{r example}
library(ralger)

my_link <- "http://elmouchir.caci.dz/search_results.php?keyword=&category=&location=Alger&submit=Trouver"

my_node <- ".listing_default" # see SelectorGadget

scrap_one(my_link, my_node)

```

If you want to scrap multiple list pages, use the `scrap_more()` function. Here we'll scrap from page 0 to page 3 (included).  

```{r example2}
my_link <- "http://elmouchir.caci.dz/search_results.php?keyword=&category=&location=Alger&submit=Trouver&page=" # mind the change within the link

scrap_more(my_link, my_node, from = 0, to = 3)

```
