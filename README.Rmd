The goal of **ralger** is to facilitate web scraping in R. 

## Installation


You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("feddelegrand7/ralger")
```
## scrap()

This is an example which shows how to extract firms denomination from the website of the [Algerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry](http://elmouchir.caci.dz) (CACI). For simplicity, we'll focus on firms operating within the capital (Alger). 

```{r example}
library(ralger)

my_link <- "http://elmouchir.caci.dz/search_results.php?keyword=&category=&location=Alger&submit=Trouver"

my_node <- ".listing_default" # see SelectorGadget

scrap(my_link, my_node)


```

If you want to scrap multiple list pages, just use `scrap()` in conjunction with `paste()`. Suppose, we want to extract the above information from the first 3 pages (starts from 0): 

```{r example2}
my_link <- "http://elmouchir.caci.dz/search_results.php?keyword=&category=&location=Alger&submit=Trouver&page=" 

my_node <- ".listing_default"

scrap(paste(my_link, 0:2), my_node)

```


## tidy_scrap()

If you want to extract information in the form of a dataframe, you can use the `tidy_scrap()` function which returns a tidy dataframe according to the arguments that you introduce. The function takes three mandatory arguments:

- **link** : which is the link of the website you're interested for;
- **nodes**: which is a vector of CSS elements that you want to extract. These elements will form the columns of your dataframe;
- **scrap_names**: this argument represents the vector of names you want to assign to your columns. Note that you should respect the same order as within the **nodes** vector. 

### Example

We'll work on the famous [IMDb website](https://www.imdb.com/). Let's say you need a dataframe composed of:

- The title of the 50 best ranked movies of all time;
- Their release year;
- Their rating.

You we'll need to use the `tidy_scrap()` function as follows: 

```{r example3}

my_link <- "https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_250&sort=user_rating"

my_nodes <- c(
  ".lister-item-header a", # The title 
  ".text-muted.unbold", # The year of release 
  ".ratings-imdb-rating strong" # The rating)
  )

names <- c("title", "year", "rating") # respect the nodes order


tidy_scrap(my_link, my_nodes, scrap_names = names)


```
Note that all columns will be of *character* class. You'll need to convert them according to your needs. Finally, I appreciate any feedback, please reach out or DM at [ihaddadenfodil](https://twitter.com/moh_fodil).
