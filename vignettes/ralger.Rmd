ralger is a package that aims to facilitate to the maximum web scraping in R. For scraping some data, you only need two elements, the **link** of the web page and the **html** or **css** node that references the needed information. Don't panic, you don't have to spend hours learning html and css. You can just use the **SelectorGadget** chrome extension. You can check out this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqNTfWrGdbk) for more information.


# scrap()

Let's dive into an example ! Suppose we want to extract all Golden Globes Best Actress Nominees (including the winner). In ralger you need only two elements: 

- The link: https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees/best-performance-actress-motion-picture-drama 

- The node: .primary-nominee a

And that's it, we're ready to scrap ! 

![2020 best actress winner](https://www.goldenglobes.com/sites/default/files/styles/portrait_medium/public/nomination/cover_images/renee_zellweger_1_0.jpg?itok=G2uI2Iuw)

```{r}
library(ralger)

data <- scrap(
  "https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees/best-performance-actress-motion-picture-drama", 
  ".primary-nominee a"
)

data

```

Pretty simple right ? I hope so. Anyway, the problem here is that the main page displays only 20 nominees, from 2017 to 2020. What if we wanted to extract all nominees in history ? Indeed, you're right, we'd have to scroll multiple pages (20 to be exact) across the website. In this context, we need to use `paste()`  in conjunction with `scrap()` as follows: 

```{r}

link <- "https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees/best-performance-actress-motion-picture-drama?page=" # Mind the change in the link structure "page=" 

node <- ".primary-nominee a" # we use the same node as previously

data_all <- scrap(paste(link, 0:20, sep = ""), node)

length(data_all)

```
And here we're we have our 350 nominees !!! `r emo::ji("smile")`
